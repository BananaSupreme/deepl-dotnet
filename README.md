The [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github-dotnet-readme) is a language
translation API that allows other computer programs to send texts and documents to DeepL's servers and receive
high-quality translations. This opens a whole universe of opportunities for developers: any translation product you can
imagine can now be built on top of DeepL's best-in-class translation technology.

The DeepL .NET library offers a convenient way for applications written in .NET to interact with the DeepL API. We
intend to support all API functions with the library, though support for new features may be added to the library after
theyâ€™re added to the API.

## Development
The test suite depends on [deepl-mock](https://www.github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mock). Run it in another terminal while executing the tests, using port 3000. Set the mock-server listening port using the environment variable `DEEPL_MOCK_SERVER_PORT`.

Execute the tests using TODO.
